# Complete Guide to Building an HPC from the Beginning

## For the first steps including instillation, follow the Rocks instillation guide.

### We are following the Rocks "Building a bare-bones compute cluster" and the "Building a more complex cluster" for Rocks 7.0 (Manzanita).

Note from Rocks: "Rocks version 7 supports a network-only installation. All rolls must be located on a roll server on a network that is accessible by your frontend".

Additional items required for installation
  Appropriate set of IP address to assign to cluster, including netmask and gateway.
  An idea for disk configuration (i.e. partitioning).
